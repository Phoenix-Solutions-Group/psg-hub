/**
 * Production trigger + suppression engine (L3, PSG-115c / PSG-218).
 *
 * Extends the pure mail-merge renderer (./templates.ts) from "fill one template"
 * to PSG's historical Master Follow-Up decision tree: which letters a recipient
 * earns is driven by the survey→EMI engagement signal and the repair record, not
 * by raw CSI. This module encodes that tree as named, marketing-tunable rules and
 * enforces the suppression hard-rules BEFORE a batch is built.
 *
 * The engagement-tier model + suppression policy here implement the named rules
 * in PSG-115d's W1 spec (docs/marketing/direct-mail/w1-copy-and-emi-segment-rules.md,
 * Part B1–B3) and pass its B4 test cases. Thresholds are tunable params (defaults
 * below) to be recalibrated against the 30-yr distribution in W0 (PSG-115e).
 *
 * Grounded in PSG's real 6-letter Master Follow-Up Program
 * (docs/psg/master-follow-up-program):
 *   1. Recommend An Agent          — survey shows agent dissatisfaction
 *   2. Agent Customer Acknowledgement — sent to the AGENT (repair started)
 *   3. Customer Call Your Agent    — survey returned + agent identified + happy
 *   4. Totaled Vehicle             — vehicle not repaired here (total loss)
 *   5. Perfect Score               — rated the experience 100%
 *   6. Estimate Follow Up          — unclosed estimate, shop-designated
 * plus the always-on Thank-You and Warranty relationship pieces and the
 * Owner Service-Recovery letter for the Disengaged tier.
 *
 * This module is PURE: no DB, no clock, no network. The batch service assembles
 * `CustomerAttributes` from survey_responses + repair_orders rows and a
 * `SuppressionList` (PSG-115e provides the live list / priors; the interface is
 * the integration point, not a hard dependency).
